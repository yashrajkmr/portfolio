## 👨‍💻 About The Project
This portfolio serves as my digital identity as a **Frontend Developer**. Unlike standard templates, this project was built from scratch to demonstrate:
* **Component-Based Architecture:** Organized file structure separating Logic, UI, and Data.
* **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS.
* **Modern React Patterns:** Usage of Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) and Functional Components.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** React.js, TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Icons:** Lucide React
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## 📂 Project Structure

src/ ├── components/ # Reusable UI components (Hero, Skills, Projects, etc.) ├── data/ # Static data files (Easy to update content without touching logic) ├── App.tsx # Main layout and scroll logic └── index.css # Tailwind directives and custom animations
